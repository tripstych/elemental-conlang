Hey man , you wanna buy some weed ?   Some what ? 
Weed ! You know ? Pot , Ganja , Mary Jane some chronic ! 
Oh , umm , no thanks . 
I also have blow if you prefer to do a few lines . 
No , I am ok , really . 
Come on man ! I even got dope and acid ! Try some ! 
Do you really have all of these drugs ? Where do you get them from ? 
I got my connections ! Just tell me what you want and I � ll even give you one ounce for free . 
Sounds good ! Let � s see , I want .   Yeah ? 
I want you to put your hands behind your head ! You are under arrest ! ,           ,           
Thetaxi drivers are on strike again .   What for ? 
They want the government to reduce the price of the gasoline . 
It is really a hot potato . ,   ,   
Wevemanaged to reduce our energy consumption in our factory by about  per cent in the last two years . 
Thats excellent . How have you managed that ? 
Mainly because weve invested in a heat recovery system . 
What does that mean exactly ? 
Well , we use the exhaust gases from our printing presses to provide energy to heat our dryers . 
What other sources of energy do you use ? 
We dont use any fossil fuels . Most of our power comes from hydro-electric plants . Were hoping to use even more energy from alternative sources in the future - perhaps even wind power . ,      ,      
Believeit or not , tea is the most popular beverage in the world after water . 
Well , people from Asia to Europe all enjoy tea . 
Right . And China is the homeland of tea .

Do you know there are several catagories of Chinese tea ? 
Yes , I believe there are green teas , black teas and scented teas . Any Others ? 
Well , have you ever heard of Oulong tea and compressed tea ? 
Oh , yeah . Oulong tea is good for ones health . isnt it ? 
You surely know a lot about Chinese tea .

Great . We can chat while enjoying a cup there .   Lets go ! ,             ,             
Whatare your personal weaknesses ? 
I � m afraid I � m a poor talker . I � m not comfortable talking with the people whom I have just met for the first time . That is not very good for business , so I have been studying public speaking . 
Are you more of a leader or a follower ? 
I don � t try to lead people . I � d rather cooperate with everybody , and get the job done by working together . 
Do you think you can make yourself easily understood in English ? 
Yes , in most circumstances .   Are you available for travel ? 
Yes , I like travelling . I am young , and unmarried . It � s no problem for me to travel frequently . ,       ,       
howlong will it take us to drive to London ? 
I think it � s a distance of  kilometers from here to London , so it should be a two-hour drive on the motorway . 
that � s unless there is a traffic jam . It could take three hours . 
you � re right . We will be able to travel at high speeds at the beginning and end of the journey , because we will be in built-up areas . 
so , shall we allow three hours to cover the distance ? 
ok . You haven � t seen my company car , have you ? 
no . let me take a look ... it � s longer than my car . 
I think it � s over five meters long . I can � t remember exactly . It has a maximum speed of over  kilometers an hour . 
wow ! That � s fast ! I don � t think we will be traveling that fast on the motorway . 
we can � t . if we went that fast , we would break the speed limit . ,         ,         
Sohow did I do on my driving test ?   Do you want the truth ? 
Of course , I do .   Well , you really didnt do all that well . 
How bad did I do ? 
To be completely honest , you failed your test .   How ? 
There were a number of reasons .   What were they ? 
Basically , you just cant drive .   Can I have another try ? 
You can take it in a couple weeks . ,           ,           
Goodmorning . Whats the matter with you ? 
Good morning , doctor . I have a terrible headache . 
All right , young man . Tell me how it got started . 
Yesterday I had a runny nose . Now my nose is stuffed up . I have a sore throat . And I � m afraid Ive got a temperature . I feel terrible . 
Dont worry , young man . Lat me give you an examination . First let me take a look at your throat . Open your mouth and sayah  . 
Ah . 
Your throat is inflamed . And your tongue is heavily coated . You have all the symptoms of influenza . 
What am I supposed to do then ?

Thank you very much . ,         ,

Thisposition demands a higher writing ability , so please say something about your writing ability . 
Of course . Ive loved writing since I was a very little boy . I won the first prize in a national composition contest when I was in middle school . After attending Nanjing University , I never give up writing . My works , such as Fathers Tobacco Pipe , Open Air Cinema , The old City were respectively published China Youth Daily , Yangzi Evening News , and New Beijing . During the period of studying for my degrees of master and doctor , I paid more attention to developing my research ability and published several papers . The Impact of Internet in Chinese Political Participation , The Discipline of Remold , The Historical Direction of Chinese Administration Reform , Bribery Cases of Self governance in Chinese Villages are respectively published in Chinese Publish Administration , Beijing Due Xuebao , Theory and Society and Chinese Reform . I joined in Yangzi Evening News to work as a part-time journalist in  . During this period , Ive written a lot of comments , which improved my writing ability to a new level , I have full confidence in my writing ability , and I believe I can do the job well . , , 
pompous. How may I help you ? 
Yes , Id like to reserve a table for dinner . 
How large a group are you expecting ?   Six couples . 
Would you like to reserve a private dining room ? 
That sounds like a good idea . 
All right . May I have your name , Sir ?

Ms. Wang , this is Mr . Cooper , president of Ivy Publishing . 
Its nice to meet you , Mr . Cooper .

Haveyou got any experience in advertising ? 
Yes , I have been working in the Public Relations Section of a company in the past two years . I plan the advertising campaign and cooperate the work of artists and typographers . Sometimes I have to do the work of a specialist when there � s something urgent . 
Do you have any practical experience as a secretary ? 
Yes , sir . I acted as a secretary in an insurance company . 
Would you tell me the essential qualities a secretary should maintain ? 
Well , to begin with , I would say she needs to be diligent , and the second point is that she has to do a lot of things on her own initiative . Finally , she can make notes in shorthand and types and has the skills in report writing , summary writing , keep minutes at meetings , and so on . Most important of all is that she seems to have a better memory than average . 
Have you had any experience with computer ? 
Yes , I studied in a computer training program , and can process data through the computer . 
Thats fine . What about operating the fax and duplicator ? 
I can handle them without any trouble

Hi, Dan . Whats new ? 
Where have you been ? Ive been trying to get in touch with you for two days . 
I went to Salt Lake City on business . Whats up ?   I got fired . 
How come ? Last time I saw you . You told me it was a good job , and youd like to take it as a career . That was only one month ago . Why this sudden change ? 
Its a long story . In a word , I didnt do a good job of it . I messed up a business deal , a deal that would have made ten million dollars and I messed it up . 
What are you going to do now ? 
I am trying to find a job asap . Lily doesnt know yet . I didnt tell her . I spent the past three days at the coffee shop next to your office , and she thought I went to work as usual . 
Thats not the way to solve the problem . Did you look in the classified advertisements column ? 
Yes , I did . But I wasnt qualified for most of the jobs that I was interested in . 
Listen . I will see what I can do , ok ? You go home and tell Lily about this problem you have now . She is your wife and I am sure she will understand . 
I just dont know how to bring it up . Well , all right . She has the right to know anyways . ,           ,           
Haveyou ever gotten a parking ticket ? 
Ive never gotten one . Have you ?   I got a ticket yesterday .

Why did you do that ?   I needed to get something really quick . 
Where did you park at ?   At my apartment building . 
Dont you have your own parking spot ?   I needed to be fast . 
That was very lazy of you . ,           ,           
Howmay I help you ?   I � m having a problem . 
What problem are you having ? 
There have been charges made on my debit card that I didn � t make . 
Do you have the statement for your card ?   Here it is . 
What are the charges you � re referring to ? 
The last four charges on the page . 
I � m afraid we � re going to have to investigate these charges . 
How long will an investigation take ? 
I honestly don � t know , but we will freeze payment on these charges . 
That sounds absolutely fantastic . ,           ,           
Goodafternoon . Can I be of service ? 
I dont know . Can I purchase Treasury Certificates here at this counter ? 
Yes , of course . We have Treasury Notes with two , three and five-year terms available . 
Two years is fine , with a value of , RIB . 
OK , could I take a look at some ID please , like a passport ? 
Here you go . By the way , is it possible to cash them before the maturity comes up ? 
No , Im afraid that isnt possible . You must wait until maturity before you cash them . ,      ,      
Hey. Why did you take that money ? You are such a cheater ! I should send you to jail ! 
I am not cheating . When you pass go , you collect $  , Everyone knows that ! 
Well you can � t just take the money . You have to ask the bank for money . And I � m the banker . 
Banker ?   Yes ...   Can I have my $  please ? 
Sure . Here you are , $  , Thank you , please come again ! Now it � s my turn to roll the dice . ,      ,      
Hi, is this Professor Clark � s office ? 
This is Professor Clark speaking . 
Hi , this is Kalina from your morning literature class . 
Yes , what can I do for you ? 
I had a skydiving accident over the weekend and won � t be able to come to school today . 
My goodness ! Are you OK ?   I broke my leg , but it is healing . 
How long will you be out of class ? 
I should be able to return by next Monday . 
Fine . Well , thanks for calling and letting me know you will be absent . I hope you feel better soon . ,         ,         
Goodafternoon ! Did you call for a plumber ? 
Yes , yes I did . Please come in ! I � m so glad you came ! This old house is falling apart ! Come on into the bathroom . See , here , there � s water leaking everywhere ! 
I see . Let me have a look . It seems that your toilet is clogged , and that � s why it won � t flush . Let me just get my plunger . No , that � s not working either . I suspect that there � s some sort of foreign object in the pipes that � s causing a blockage . That � s what � s making your toilet overflow . 
Oh , that must be because of my four-year-old daughter . She is always flushing things down the toilet . You know how kids are . 
Yeah , I have a little one myself . Anyway , these water pipes are really rusty , so they also should be changed . Thatcould be causing water to not drain completely , that might lead to more problems in the future . I would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn � t shutting off properly . I could have it all finished by today if it � s urgent . 
That would be great ! Is it expensive ? 
Let � s see ... I would say about eight hundred dollars . ,      ,      
Listen, Karen , I need your help . I dont know anyone here yet . 
Im glad to help you . Whats wrong ? 
My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L.A.Hank and I will be flying there tonight . 
Im sorry to hear it . Whats wrong with her ? 
Doctors arent sure yet.But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we dont want to take her with us . But we dont know who can stay with her . 
You need a babysitter . 
Yes , Id ask Jill , the girl Ive had before , but I need someone overnight.Maybe even for two nights . 
I could have Suzy stay at my place . 
I dont want to do that to you , Karen .   Why not ? 
Your own kids would get Suzys cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I dont know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days . 
I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston.She is  , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely . 
Id like to talk with her.This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight . 
Ill get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible . 
Im glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I dont want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it.But Id rather have someone a little older . 
Ill go home and get Saras number . Ill call her first myself . 
Great . Then call me and let me know if shes free . ,                ,                
Goodevening . Whatll you have ?

Fine , thank you , and how are you ? 
Very well , thank you . Its nice to meet you again . I am awfully sorry for not being able to meet you at the airport , as I was busy yesterday . I do hope you had a very enjoyable trip from New York . 
Yes , a very pleasant journey indeed . Thank you . 
How are you getting along with your business ? 
Not bad . The fur market is not very brisk lately , but the selling season is advancing near . I hope there will be more buyers in the market this year . 
I hope we can do more business together . Though we are satisfied with our past trade record , there are still possibilities for more business . In the meantime , lets discuss other spheres of cooperation , such as investment , technology transfer and technical assistance . ,      ,      
Bythe way miss , where is the toilet ? 
Toilets are in the rear , I am afraid all the toilets are fully occupied at the moment . 
What ? Oh , what we live ! Thank you very much for your help , miss . 
You are welcome . ,   ,   
excuseme , could you tell me which line I � m supposed to stand in to buy bubble wrap and to post a package ? 
you can buy the bubble wrap here , but you � ll have to stand in line over here to post your passage . 
that � s a really long line . How long do you think it � ll take to get through all those people ? 
it takes about  minutes per person , so it � ll probably be about an hour � s wait . 
can I buy stamps here ?   sure . How many would you like ? 
I need  for my Christmas cards .   are you sending them abroad ? 
twenty of them are going abroad to China and America . 
do you have any going anywhere in the EU ? If you do , those are less expensive . 
no . 
ok , here you go . That will be  pounds and seventy two pence . 
and the bubble wrap ?   that � s another quid . 
thanks a lot . You � Ve been very helpful . ,              ,              
Goodevening , Saliva . Whats that wonderful aroma from your kitchen ? What are you doing now ? 
I am cooking now !   Are you good at cooking ? 
I have studied its skills recently at a training school . I plan to run a restaurant , so I have to practise cooking ! 
It is a good idea . What dish are you cooking now ? ! 
I am steaming fish in a pressure cooker . Have you ever tried steamed fish ? 
Yes , I have . But the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious . The fish is not well-done and too salty . 
Thats the case . I think there is not enough time to steam it and soy sauce is too much . 
I have the same idea as yours . 
Its OK . Please have a taste of it . 
Thank you . Oh , its very delicious . 
Thank you for your praise . 
Besides steamed fish , what else are you good at cooking ? 
I am good at stewing beef with potato , frying chicken , hot and sour soup etc . 
So many dishes . Next Friday week is my birthday . I would like to invite you to cook for my dinner party , OK ? 
Why not ? It is a good opportunity for me to practise cooking . 
Thanks a lot .   Its my pleasure . ,                 ,

It can be solved by drawing a draft on us at  days sight . 
What about a draft at  days sight ? 
All right . But we demand the draft be accepted by a bank acceptable to us . 
A banks acceptance will add to the costs of our imports . You can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due . 
Then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank . You know we exports would like to have our investments returned as early as possible . 
I hope this transaction will pave the way for further business relations between our two countries . 
So do I . ,       ,

Hi, George . Im going to have a job interview next week . Could you give me some advice ? 
Sure . First of all , it � s very important for you not to be late . Job interviewers usually don � t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic . 
Yeah , thats very important . 
So you � d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment . 
I � ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer . 
That � s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about  to  minutes . 
It � s always easier to say something than to do it . 
It � s not too difficult to make a good impression . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications . 
But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans . 
I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes . 
It � s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes . 
You misunderstood me . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous . 
I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time . 
You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement . 
It seems that  clothes make the man  . 
It may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior . ,               ,               
Theboss announces the pay raise today , right ? How much do you think well get ? 
No idea . Your guess is as good as mine .

Imsorry , our appointment has to be changed .   What a pity ! 
If you dont mind , may we put it off to the next day ? 
Thats OK . ,   ,   
Goodday ! Welcome to Lincoln Bank , how may we assist you ?

Yes , I have designed some programs for the network with Visual C + + and I have passed the test for programmers - MUSE . 
Have you got anything to ask me ? 
Yes , can you tell me whats my responsibility in this position ? 
Yes , of course . You would be responsible for the development of software products .

Ok , I will contact you in a week . See you . 
Thank you , bye-bye . ,                  ,

Yes , twice now . I think its too high-tech , and so its the first part that breaks . 
Hmm . You know , the problem might be dust . Did you clean the unit often ? 
Well . No , I didnt clean it.But still , I only had the last one two months , and it broke . I dont trust auto-reverse . 
Alright . Well . We have many units without auto-reverse.Here is a good unit . Very reliable.It has an AM / FM band , built-in microphone , recording capability , and no auto-reverse . 
How much is it ?   This one sells for $ . . 
Can I test it out ?   Of course . 
It sounds great . Ill take it . 
Fine . I think youll be happy with it . Its a very good unit . Very reliable . Ill go get you a new one in a box . I will be back in just a moment . 
Thanks . ,                   ,                   
Tellme about yourself . 
I was born and raised in Beijing . I attended Peking University and received my bachelors degree in Economics . I have worked for  years as a financial consultant in Beijing for China Pacific Insurance Co . Ltd . 
What type of position are you looking for ? 
Im looking for a position in which I can utilize my experience . 
Are you interested in a full-time or part-time position ? 
I am more interested in a full-time position . However , I would also consider a part-time position . 
Can you tell me about your responsibilities at your last job ? 
I advised customers on financial matters . After I consulted the customer , I completed a customer inquiry form and catalogued the information in our database . I then collaborated with colleagues to prepare the best possible package for the client . The clients were then presented with a summarized report on their financial activities that I formulated on a quarterly basis . 
What is your greatest strength ? 
I am an excellent communicator . People trust me and come to me for advice . One afternoon , my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well . I made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together . 
What is your greatest weakness ? 
I tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisfied . However , I began setting time-limits for myself . 
Why do you want to work for our company ? 
After following your firms progress for the last  years , I am convinced that your company is becoming one of the market leaders and I would like to be a part of that team . 
When can you begin ?   Immediately . ,               ,               
Pleasetell me how to file things according to the concerned rules . 
Well , all right . There are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents , information and other things . 
What are they ? 
They are keep the documents in chronological order , remove all the chips and pins , punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder . 
And what is the most important point ? 
You should always remember that one customer one file is the rule . ,     ,     
Yeah, look at all those new buildings going up ! Mr . Zhang , the traffic is pretty smooth . But we were told the roads from the airport to downtown were quite crowded and traffic jams could be as long as half an hour . 
Yes , they were . But it has already past . The traffic from the airport to downtown has been relieved after the completion of Yanan Aerial Road . 
Weve never expected that Shanghai is such a big metropolis , same as New York city . David , would it be a good idea to rent a car here ? Ive got an international drivers license with a pretty good record in the States . 
Thats wonderful . OK . Ill remember that . But I have to warn you that you must drive very carefully in the downtown area , for therere no separate lanes for motor vehicles and bicycles in some places , and still quite a few people dont take road regulations seriously . ,   ,   
Thishouse is not looking all that great from here 
You can � t really tell everything about a house from the outside . Let � s go inside . 
I don � t think that it is looking any better inside here . 
I think that fresh paint and cleaning would help it look a little better . 
It is just too dark in here with so few windows . 
I hear that the kitchen is quite large . Let � s go check it out . 
The kitchen may be large , but it doesn � t have any storage space . 
The master suite is supposed to be quite elegant . Maybe it will be a little better . 
How many dogs live in this house ? 
I think that we have seen all that we need to see here . Let � s go look at another house . ,         ,         
Excuseme , waiter , I would like to have some wine before the main course .

Thats great , bring me a bottle of that please . ,    ,    
Comeon ! Its time to go !

Hum ... Why not go shopping the day after tomorrow ? Tomorrow is Saturday . I hate all the hustle and bustle of Saturday shopping . 
But Sunday is the same with Saturday . If you don � t mind , thats OK .

Now press this button . 
Oh , and its out of paper . Do you have any more ? 
Just a second . Ill go get some . ,       ,       
Ineed help using the washer and dryer . 
Tell me what the problem is . 
I cant figure out how to turn them on . 
Do you have some quarters ?   I didnt know I needed change . 
The washer costs  cents and the dryer costs a dollar . 
Where do I put the change ? 
The quarters go into the slot . You have to push the slot in , and the machine will turn on . 
Is that everything that I have to do ?   Thats all there is . 
I appreciate you helping me with this .

Yes . Thats the company policy . 
It was the same as the last place I worked at . I was hoping you � d be different . ,       ,       
Iam absolutely famished .   Yeah . I am too . 
Where did you want to go for lunch ? 
I was thinking we should just go to the cafeteria . 
I dont think I ever got food from the cafeteria . 
I actually like the food there . 
Does the cafeteria sell a lot of different food ? 
They have anything you want . 
I was thinking about getting some Chinese food . 
I bought some chow mein at the cafeteria . It tasted great .

I think youll really like the food there . ,           ,           
Hereis the draft contract , Mr . Brown . Lets discuss the clauses to see if we agree on all of them . Then I will make out an original of the contract . After that , whats left is to fill out the contract and sign our names . 
Thats OK . 
The contract is to be written in Chinese and English . Both languages are equally effective . 
Fine . If youll excuse me , Id like to go it over first . ( After about  minutes ) Hmm , youve done a pretty good job . Its well prepared . 
Thank you . 
Well , I suggest that we discuss only the clauses and points where we have different opinions just to save time . 
Thats a good idea . 
First , lets read Clause Two about packing . Its our usual practice to ship our products in containers . Thatll save time and money , but your contract stipulates the use of wooden cases . So , wed like to have the words containers are allowed in the contract . 
Agreed . 
For shipment , you know we are producing a complete set of equipment for you and it wont all be finished at one time . So would you allow us to make partial shipments . 
I understand your position . ,          ,          
Iwant to buy a black suit . 
Certainty.Do you want double breasted suit or single breasted suit ? 
I prefer single breasted suit . 
What about this one ? Its a very nice  - piece suit .

Howdo you do ? Nice to meet you , Diane . 
How do you do , Jack . Nice to meet you . 
Well , I think you  Ve reconsidered our proposal , Diane . 
Yes , you are right . After all , the quality of your air conditioners is good . The only problem is price . 
I should not be surprised , many customers have the same opinion . Do you have any suggestion in mind ? Our salesman told your secretary that the price could be negotiable . 
Thats why I came to your office today . We think for your model WE -  $  would be reasonable , because air conditioners of the same kind sold by other companies are usually about - . 
Thats true . But if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product , youll agree that  is not high , especially when we allow you a  % discount . 
I see your point . Thats to say s  each set . Still its much higher than the market price . Could you see your way to reduce the price , Jack ? 
Well , considering the quantity of your order we could further reduce the price to  . Thats the best we can do . What do you think of that ? 
All right . We accept it . So $  for each set . 
Very well . Thank you . ,          ,          
DontI know you ?   Im not sure.You look familiar . 
Youre Mr.Stevenson , right ?

Yes , I have an overall understanding .

Then when will I get a reply at the latest ? 
If you pass the interview , the personnel department will inform you within two weeks . 
But if I dont pass , will you call me ? 
Im sorry we wont . You can wait for two weeks . If you dont get a telephone call , it means that you werent successful . 
Then do I have the chance to get this job ? 
Im sorry but I cant make the final decision myself , and I have to discuss it with other interviewers .

Your mentality is very good and thats great . 
Thanks for giving me the opportunity of this interview . 
My pleasure . ,            ,

Margaret, Id like to follow up with the arrangements for our company retreat , to take place next month . We need to book the venue , make arrangements for speakers and door prizes , and set up all the activities and accommodations . Also , very important , we need to determine which of our staff will be eligible and will be available to go . Weve got to get a head count in order to make reservations . 
Whats the criteria for staff to attend ? Are we only including our management team in this affair ? Or will we be extending invitations to lower level employees to attend ? 
Lower level employees need not attend . The purpose of this retreat is for training , especially for our management team . We want to develop a well-oiled machine on our executive level . In order to get everyone to jell together , weve got to include some fun . Thats the reason for the retreat . ,  ,  
Ithink Yoga might be suitable for me .   Why ? 
Because it doesnt require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up . 
But I see people sweat a lot doing Yoga too . 
I dont know . I just need to try it once . Im in urgent need of some exercise to lose some weight . 
You should try swimming then . It helps you to keep fit . ,     ,     
Weare looking for a bilingual secretary . Do you think you are proficient in both written and spoken English ?

Whatsthe matter with me , Doctor ? I feel so tired these days . 
Is your blood pressure , Im afraid . Its far too high . 
And whats the cause of that ? 
Overwork-amongst other things . You cant work  hours a day . You  Ve got to slow down . 
But I cant just slow down . 
Youve got to , Im afraid . And look at this . You weigh  stones . Thats too much for a man of your size . 
You mean Ive got to lose weight ? 
Yes . Youve got to cut down on bread and potatoes and take more exercise . ,       ,       
Youare an early bird , Tom . What do you do in the morning then ? 
Exercise . The morning hours are the most precious period within a single day . We should not pass them up easily . Seize the time and do something useful . 
So , you choose to spend it on bodybuilding . Where do you exercise ? 
Usually , I run to the Black Bamboo Park as a warm-up . Admission is free . Then I start my activities . 
Do you do the same exercises every day ? 
No , Ive deliberately kept a balance between various exercises ; parallel bars , push-ups , sit-ups , bunny-hops , five-kilometer run , and so on . I alternate them over the weekdays . Sometimes , when I find myself in a bad state , I will simply idle about in the park . 
Why dont you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising ? 
Its not easy to keep a good habit , you know . I fear that if I fail to get up early one day , I may find it still more difficult to rise early the next . Besides , a mere walk in the early morning is much fun , too . Here and there in the park , you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs , playing erhu , chess , or just chatting and gossiping . Its interesting to join them . 
Oh , yes . Singing is also a good way of keeping fit , at least mentally . ,        ,        
Iwant some cosmetics.Could you recommend some ? 
I think Ponds is the best .   And theyre very dear , too . 
Theyre on special offer today .   Oh , thats ideal . ,    ,    
Steven, Im going abroad by plane for the first time tomorrow . Can you give me some advice ? And what should I pay attention to ? 
First , you should have enough sleep to get over the jet lag before the departure . Most people will suffer from jet lag for a few days after a long flight . 
I will go to bed early tonight .   Do you have an airsickness ? 
I dont know . But I have a carsickness . 
Youd better bring some medicine for airsickness .   Thank you . ,      ,      
Canwe choose a time to look at houses together ? 
Can you do that in the mornings , or would the afternoons be best ? 
Either way is good for me . 
There are a number of open houses this weekend in your area . Would that okay with you ? 
I can take a little time off of work , or I can go on a weekend , also . 
We could meet at the real estate office , or I could pick you up at your home . 
I am leaving from work , so maybe I could just meet you at the first house that we will look at . 
I can think of five houses that we should look at . It will take most of the day . 
I would like to see as many as possible . 
When I have confirmed the times with the owners , I will e-mail you our plans for the day . ,         ,

Here you are . ,     ,     
What� s the problem ? Things are getting out of hand . You keep sticking your nose where it doesn � t belong . 
What do you mean ? 
Now , I am responsible for training new staff , but you keep overriding my authority by trying to pose your methods . I know you are a hotshot college graduate with something to prove . But I don � t like your way . ,  ,  
Mom, when you come home , please buy a coat , a skirt , a sweater ... 
Enough is enough . I know . , ,

Doyou remember what the ratings of movies stand for ? 
Yes , G stands for General Audiences , PG means Parental Guidance suggested , R is restricted to audiences under  and X means explicit content . 
Does anyone pay any attention to those ratings anymore ? 
Remember when we were kids ? Theaters wouldnt let kids in to PG moves without a parent . 
I remember that I never saw an X moves even displayed . 
Now with video rentals its all a personal matter . 
Yea , I never see theaters turn people away for their age anymore either .

Very well . We started organizing everything early to avoid a last minute rush to get things done . The only thing that isn � t ready yet is my wedding dress . 
When will that be ready ? 
The dressmakers said that is would be ready in two weeks . 
You � re getting married in three weeks . So that should be ok . So , you � Ve prepared the church , catering , transport , hotel-everything .

Wereyou able to attend Friday nights basketball game ? 
I was unable to make it . 
You should have been there . It was intense . 
Is that right . Who ended up winning ?   Our team was victorious . 
I wish I was free that night . Im kind of mad that I didnt go .

Thats the reason it was such a great game . 
The next game , I will definitely be there . ,           ,           
Haveyou ever tried shopping online ? 
No , never . I prefer to actually see and touch what Im buying before I pay for it , especially for clothes and shoes . 
Thats right . Seeing is believing . 
Ive heard some friends say when they get the article , its quite different from what they see on the website advertisement . 
That happens . Without close quality examination , we may encounter fraud , and the e-shop may suddenly disappear . 
Whats more , its not always so safe for us to pay online as hackers might steal the user name and password . 
Its said that some measures have been taken to deal with this problem . Paying online is much safer than before , but I still have the feeling that its not safe enough . 
I cant agree more . thats why I only do street shopping . 
Me too . Sometimes I surf online shops to check some related information , and then go to a physical store to do the actual shopping . 
Thats a good idea . ,         ,

Goodmorning , everyone . Let me introduce myself to you ... 
You dont need to introduce yourself , Yang . Youre famous .

OK , OK ! 
Now , Id like to get things under way . The main topic on todays agenda is the development of a U . S . sales strategy for the new EBB . Id like to hear all of your ideas , Mr . Wall , you seem in top form today . Could you start the ball rolling ? 
Uh , oh , sure . Well , I think we should keep in mind that the key to good sales is advertising . 
Well , thats kind of obvious .   Give me a break , Mr Yang . 
Uh , lets keep this going , shall we ? ,        ,        
Imsorry , but I dont think this damage is our fault . 
What do you mean ?   It looks like the shipping company did this . 
Wed better take it up with them , in that case . ,   ,   
I� m glad you could find time to meet with me , Mr . Johnson . I can � t think of a nicer environment for our meeting today , the ambiance here is lovely ! 
No problem , if possible I always combine business with pleasure . Now , let � s hear more about these chocolates you � re offering . 
Well , as you know , I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States . They � re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . Naturally , your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant , luxurious , first class dining . 
Mmmm , sounds interesting ... gourmet chocolates , where are they produced ? Belgium ? 
Actually , the factory is located in Scotland . 
Really ? I didn � t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production 
That � s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . They � Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . Here , I brought these especially for you , try one ! 
Oh , thanks . Mmm , hmm , creamy texture , very smooth ... 
Unique , aren � t they ? I bet you � Ve never tasted anything like it ! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one � s cutting corners with the ingredients . Only the creme make it through inspection . 
Yes , very interesting flavors ... Slightly spicy , very unique , that � s for sure . Exactly what ARE the ingredients ? 
I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations . I � m sure you can keep a secret . Buttermilk , cacao beans , sugar and Haggis . 
Haggis ? What � s Haggis ? 
It � s a traditional Scottish delicacy , you take sheep � s liver , heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep � s stomach . 
Ah , get back to you .   Mr . Johnson ? Mr . Johnson ? ,              ,              
Doyou need a guide ? 
Yes , we are just looking for one . Whats the charge per day ? 
Its $  . If you are staying for more than  days in the city , the charge is $  per day . 
Thats reasonable . ,   ,   
Arentyou Jim Green ?   Yes , thats right . 
I believe we met at a concert last year . Im Taylor . 
Oh , yes . I remember . ,   ,   
Lucy, I � d like to fix the light in the corridor , it keeps flashing , which drives me crazy . Would you like to help me with the ladder ? 
Monica , wait a moment . I think we � d better call the repair man to do it . 
I think I can handle it by myself . 
I � d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company . 
I see . If I got hurt when fixing the light , even during office hours , I wouldn � t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility . 
Other company rules also need your attention . 
Like this one ? Never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder.Yeah , thank you for telling me . 
Don � t mention it . ,       ,       
ThankGod ! I am finished writing that service guide ! It took me forever ! 
When did you finish ? 
This morning ! No more overtime , and no more headaches ! 
Well , I � m glad to hear it . Have a cup of coffee ! ,   ,   
Ididn � t receive an unemployment check this week and need to know why . 
Did you mail us your last Continued Claim Form ? 
I am afraid that I forgot to send it in . 
We cannot pay you unless you turn that form in every two weeks . 
Is it too late to mail the Continued Claim Form in now ? 
It can � t be more than fourteen days late for us to accept it . 
I will mail it in a little early next time to avoid this problem . 
You can � t possibly know in advance how much you will be working . If you mail it in too soon , we will reject it ! 
Will my paycheck arrive late because I messed up on my form ? 
Your check will be arriving late , but the next one will come right on time . ,         ,         
Ishould tell you that Im checking out in about  minutes . 
Im ready when you are , sir . 
Very good ! Now , its still morning here in New York . 
You are so right , sir . The clock just struck nine . 
Im going to spend some time exploring the city . What can I do with my luggage ? 
Sir , right here we have a storage site . Its only $  an hour , but you need to leave a deposit . 
A deposit ? Isnt my luggage a deposit ? 
Im sorry , sir , but it isnt . Your MasterCard or VISA will take care of things nicely . 
Okay . Let me think about this . 
Okay , sir . But dont take too long . You only have  minutes . ,         ,

Heyhoney , how was your day ? 
It was alright . I ran into Bill and we got to talking for a while . He � s in a bit of a jam . 
Why ? What happened ? 
Well , his son had an accident and Bill doesn � t have health insurance . This really got me thinking , and I wondered if we shouldn � t look into a couple of different HMO � s . 
Yeah , you � re right . We aren � t getting any younger and our kids are getting older . 
Exactly ! I searched on the web and found a couple of HMO � s with low co-pays and good coverage . The deductibles are low , too . 
Sounds good , although , do you think we can qualify for insurance ? Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money . 
Well , we don � t have any pre-existing illnesses or conditions , so we should be fine . 
I wish our company or country provided us with healthcare . 
Not in a million years ! ,         ,

Ineed something to wash this down . Is there any juice in the fridge ? 
What is that ? It looks like something from a swamp ! 
Its a green drink . Its supposed to be full of vitamins and minerals . 
You know , healthy eating doesnt have to make you gag .

Hi, Sam . I want to buy a pet . Do you have any ideas ? 
You really should go to Rachels pet store . 
Why ? anything special there ? 
Its more than special . You can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more . 
Oh , really ? are there any snakes ? 
Snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! its a world of exotic pets . 
Thats terrific . I cant wait to check it out . 
Hang on . are you sure you want to keep a non-traditional pet ? 
Why not ? its so cool .   But it will pose a risk to your health . 
Pardon ? 
I mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria , they are likely to cause immune system problems . 
Well , I didnt realize that . 
I dont believe its a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children . 
Oh , I should have thought of my brothers baby girl . Maybe Ill just have a dog instead of an exotic pet . 
Yes , good luck , Maria . ,               ,

yes . 
well , the editor-in-chief heard that I had experience as an editor at another magadize and asked me if I was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him .

she said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that I could be in charge of the column until she came back .

Im really looking forward to reading your column . 
me , too . Do you want to go out to celebrate my good news ?

perhaps we could go to the library festival thats going on at the local bookshop . ,                ,

its Martin Scorsese . You liked his film , The Departed , didnt you ? 
yes , it was fantastic ! Can I read the article when youre finished ? 
sure . You know it has an online edition , too . You should go online to read if you want to read it now . 
thats ok . Ill wait until youre finished . Just out of curiosity , do you have a subscription for that magadize ? 
no . I dont buy it regularly enough for it to be worthwhile . 
how much does the magadize cost ? 
its almost three pounds now , and I think theyre going to put the price up to four pounds soon . 
thats quite expensive . Who is their target audience ? 
Cosmo mainly has a middle-class readership , but I think circulation will fall dramatically if the price goes up anymore . 
I bet youll still buy it , though . You wouldnt be able to live without your fashion magazine ! ,             ,             
Wei! This is a first-you didnt bargain ! 
Bargain ? Id feel way too guilty . 
But you could have saved money . 
From a sweet ma ? ! Its not worth it . Plus , Id happily pay more for these things I bought ! 
F . Y . I . , there is a flea market nearby , but maybe youre done ... 
Ha ! Im just warming up ! Please take me there now ! ,     ,     
Canyou help me do an internet search ?

Haha , I could never do that . I � d be a zombie if I didn � t have my morning coffee fix . Let � s get down to business then . 
Yes . I � Ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone . The demand for phone cameras is growing , and Pear has been falling behind in the market . 
That � s great ! I � m glad to hear that Pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon . Right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras . Is Pear still interested in having those ? 
No , we � re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels . We were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal .

He took the money and tried to get away . 
Did the cops show up in time ? 
He didnt even make it out the door . ,           ,

hello ! I was exhausted form studying , so I decided to read the newspaper to relax . Unfortunately , the news is so depressing . There has been another murder in the city center . I � m shocked that the pole 
people are starting to get frightened by it . Everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder . 
you mean if they catch the murderer . I � m scared stiff about going into the city center at night . 
there must have been some good news in the newspaper . I can � t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited . 
well , there was one good piece of news . You remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease ? 
yes . Her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states . 
well , they � Ve got the money and she � s going tomorrow for treatment . 
I � m so happy for the family ! They must be very relieved and excited about that . 
I � m sure they are . Oh , and a local man won the lottery . I � m so jealous ! I wish it were me ! I buy a lottery ticket every week and I � m amazed that I haven � t even won a small prize yet . It � s so unfair ! 
don � t be moody ! I hope you � re not tired , because we � Ve been invited to a party this evening . I know how excited you get about parties . ,          ,

Sure . Wait a minute . ,   ,   
Itsespecially cold when the wind is blowing .

Ok . What do you think about our living room ? 
Well , I do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table , but I don � t really care for curtains . Did you get them at a yard sale ? They look ancient . 
My parents gave them to us as a house warming gift . 
Oh dear . Well , I suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? It seems a bit dusty in here . 
Your daughter usually does the dusting , and I do the vacuuming .

We have thought of you carefully with discretion , but the other candidate has more experiences . 
Experience is important , but dont you think capability is more valuable than that ? 
Yes , I think so . But how do you prove to me that you are more capable ? 
Maybe you can hire me on trial . If Im not qualified for the job , you can let me go . 
Good idea . ,     ,     
Excuseme , sir.Is there a barber near here ? 
Yes , the nearest one is at the third cross of this road . 
Im a stranger here.How can I get there , please ? 
Just walk down the road for a few minutes , and youll find it on your right . 
Thank you very much . ,    ,    
Unfortunately, according to our regulations I have to confiscate these counterfeit notes . 
So , this  RIB is worthless ? 
Im sorry but it is our regulation , so I must follow it . We will issue you with a receipt to show that the notes you presented us with are counterfeit and have been confiscated . Then , if you wish to pay in some more cash , you are free to do so . 
Right , I see . Let me give you another  RIB . 
Heres your Passbook back and the receipt to say we confiscated the  RIB worth of counterfeit notes . 
Thanks . Now can I make the full deposit ? 
Yes . Please fill in a new deposit slip and we can continue . ,      ,      
Ok, honey , time to take down the Christmas tree . 
Do we have to ? 
Come on , it � s losing needles all the time and the branches are sagging . 
It � s not that bad , besides it really looks nice in that corner . It gives the room a good atmosphere . 
A good atmosphere ? The tree is falling apart , and it � s messing up the room . 
But it makes the place feel so much like Christmas . I � d really hate to have to take it down . 
But Christmas was two weeks ago ! It � s been there only because we � Ve been too busy to get rid of it . 
I know , but it seems like such a shame to have to take it away . 
But it � s falling apart , and the cat keeps playing with the lower branches . 
I know , I know . But it reminds me of the great Christmas we just had . All of us were here - - my parents , your parents , the kids , and the cousins - - the food was good , and everybody got what they wanted . 
Yeah , it was a good Christmas . It won � t always be this good , but we can � t make it last longer than it should . 
Ok , fine . We need to take down the tree . 
I � ll make a deal with you . We � ll leave it up until Sunday , and then we � ll take it down after church . ,            ,

Sotell me , whats the difference between the Board of Directors , the CEO , and the stockholders ? They all seems ot be the same group of people to me ... 
No , theres a definite difference . You know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... theyre the financial control system . Then theres the CEO � the chief executive officer . Hes the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . Its too dangerous . Thats the reason for a Board of Directors . The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . They could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased . 
How many people are on the board of directors ? 
Usually not more than  , not less than  . They meet monthly , quarterly , or biannually to oversee an organization or company . They provide long term planing and vision , and also act as moral watchdogs rto keep the company in line . ,   ,   
Howmuch will my pay be , if you don � t mind my asking ? 
We would like to start you off at , yuan a month , not including bonus and overtime pay . We don � t give bonus every month , but we offer a semi-annual bonus . And you will receive two weeks paid vacation a year , as well . Does it suit you ? 
Yes , thank you . May I ask for an apartment ? 
No problem . Well supply you with an apartment of two bedrooms and a living room . ,   ,   
Mum, can I finish my homework later ? 
Sorry . You know the rules .   But I want to watch TV now . 
That � s out of the question .   Please .   Not a chance . 
Not even for an hour ?   Sorry , it � s impossible . ,       ,       
Where� s Sally , Jack ?   She � s in the garden , Jane . 
What � s she doing ?   She � s sitting under the tree . 
Is Tim in the garden , too ? 
Yes , he is . He � s climbing the tree . 
I beg your pardon ? Who � s climbing the tree .   Tim is . 
What about the dog ? 
The dog � s in the garden , too . It � s running across the grass . It � s running after a cat . ,         ,         
Whatswrong with you ?   I have a sore throat and headache . 
Do you feel tired ?

Unfortunately , I just can � t make it this time . I have to go straight home . It � s my second wedding anniversary , and we � re supposed to be having a big dinner Susan would kill me if I missed it . 
Happy anniversary ! Sorry you won � t be there . Maybe some other time ? 
Yeah , maybe . Thanks , anyway . Hope you guys have a great time ! ,     ,     
Excuseme . Do you mind if I try this on ? 
Not at all . The changing rooms are just this way . 
Thanks . Its a little tight . Do you have any in a larger size ? 
Sure . Ill give you the next size up . That one is small , right ? 
Yes . Also , Im not so sure about the color . 
Well.It doesnt go with your skirt . I think the color itself is fine though . ,     ,     
Areyou going to vote ?   Of course ! Are you ? 
I plan to , but what day is the election ?   You should know that . 
Can you just tell me ?   The election is this Tuesday . 
Are you serious ?   I � m not kidding . 
It � s a good thing I asked you . 
That should � Ve been something you knew already . 
I couldn � t remember .   Whatever . Just make sure you go vote . ,           ,

OK , but dont tell anyone what I said . ,      ,      
Youget your bus pass ?   Im not going to buy one . 
Youre not ?   I think its a waste of money . 
It actually costs less if you have a bus pass .   How is that ? 
You can use it however many times you need to .   Is that right ? 
Yup , and you can keep the money in your pocket . 
That sounds nice .   You should go get yours . 
Yeah , I think I will . ,           ,

Ill have ham and egg with French fries . What dessert do you want ? 
Banana pie .   Where shall we sit ?   How about there ? ,      ,      
Doyou like cooking ? 
I love it . I really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it.It gives me a real sense of satisfaction.Do you enjoy cooking ? 
I don � t like it.It takes up too much time and I really hate having it clean up after the meal . I can � t stand doing the washing up , drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away . 
You can ask the guests for help . My guests usually insist on doing the washing up . I just have to remind them where everything goes . 
So what kinds of dishes do you usually make ? I know you like Italian food . 
Italian , Indian and chinese . I � Ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and I need some more practice . 
Do you find it hard to get ingredients for Chinese food ? 
Not at all.You can find most of them in supermarkets.The ingredients are usually the same as in Western food.The way that the food is prepared is the big difference , not the ingredients . 
How long does it take you to cook a meal for  or  people ? 
Obviously , it depends on what I � m cooking.But I � d say it generally takes about one and a half hours . ,         ,         
Imsearching for an old music box . 
You came to the right place . Any particular decade ? 
If you had a box made in the  s , that would be nice . 
We just got one in yesterday , so now we have six . 
Would any of them have dancing figures ? 
Yes , we still have two boxes left that have dancing figures . 
Oh , theyre both so beautiful . Let me have this one , I think . 
That one truly is a beautiful piece of work , isnt it ? 
One last question 
Oh , no . Everything we sell here is  as is .  
I guess I was asking for too much . 
If it breaks down , maybe you can find a repairman on the Internet . ,           ,           
Wehave been over this a hundred times ! We are not getting a pet ! 
Why not ? Come on ! Just a cute little puppy . or a kitty ! 
Who is going to look after a dog or a cat ? 
I will ! I � ll feed it , bathe it and walk it every day ! We can get a Labrador or a German Shepard ! 
What if we want to take a vacation ? Who will we leave it with ? Plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog . 
Ok . How about we get a cat or a ferret ? 
We � re planning on having children soon , I don � t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house . 
Fine ! Let � s get a bird then ! We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! A parrot would be awesome ! 
I � ll tell you what , I can get you some hamsters and we � ll take it from there . 
Yay ! ,         ,         
Overhere is our gym . We have all the latest equipment . 
But I havent used exercising equipment before . Can you tell us some more details ? 
Certainly . We have here the race apparatus , stationary bike , muscle builder set , chest expander , bar bell , dumb bell and so on . 
Working in the gym is a very good way for losing weight . What else do you have ? 
Heres the swimming pool . Its open from  a . m . to  p . m . There are also massage rooms here . 
Thats wonderful ! I like swimming . ,     ,     
John, I was looking through some magazines for ideas about where we might go on vacation this year . 
Ive already told my buddy , Mark , that I am going hunting with him in Alaska . 
You cant be serious ! 
Hey , Ive always gone hunting or fishing on vacation . I am sorry that bothers you . 
After a year together , I thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together . 
Says who ? I dont think that is necessarily the case . 
You know , now that I think about it , I really dont have much more to say to you at all ! 
Whatever you say ! ,       ,       
Haveyou declared your income and are you prepared to pay tax ? 
Not yet . I dont know how to fill out the form . What is the tax-free allowance for supporting a dependent ? 
I dont really know . Why not ask the accountant or the lawyer of the law firm ? They will tell you which is subject or not subject to taxation . He can even help you avoid paying tax legally . 
If I dont pay my taxes , would the tax officials discover it ? 
Certainly . No one who evades tax can escape from their detection.They  ll check your income through computers . Youd better make a declaration to the tax authorities as soon as possible . If you fail to meet the deadline , you will be fined . ,    ,    
Whatsup ? You sound a little down in dumps . 
I quarreled with my roommate last night . He is really stubborn . 
Calm down ! Shouting won � t help ?   He is really outrageous . 
What happened ? 
I went back home last night . You know tired as a dog , so I took a quick shower and went to bed . I couldnt fall asleep , because Brian was there in the living room , playing his stupid stereo so loud . I kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . He shouted at me . 
What ? He cant do this to you . 
Well , he did it anyway . Then he came into my room and shot all his shit blah blah blah ... you know . 
What did you do ?   I shouted it back of course . 
Hold it , Mike . You wont accomplish anything by hollering at him , right ? You worked it all up till now . Why not wait until you cool down a bit ? 
What would you do if you were in my shoes ? 
Just stay cool . You know . When you get back home tonight , tell him that you didnt mean to quarrel with him . 
No way , Kate . I mean its just not my fault . 
I know . It wouldnt hurt much to say sorry first . And after that , you can casually mention the problem . I am sure he will cooperate . 
I am too angry to do that . ,               ,               
Excuseme . I am looking for a book called Little Women , but I cant find it anywhere . 
Let me see . I am sorry we just have sold it out . 
Will you have it later ? 
I think so . Could I have you name , telephone number ? If we get one , I will call you . 
Thats terrific . Thank you . ,    ,    
Whodo you think is the greatest novelist in the history of English literature ? 
Charles Dickens.Actually no one can parallel him in writing . 
Im afraid I cant agree with you on that . I like D.H.Laurence  s novels better . ,  ,  
Whatgame do you like ? 
I like board games . I like chinese chess and draughts . 
I � Ve never played Chinese chess before , but I � Ve seen old men playing it in the street . It looks complicated . 
It � s about as complicated as chess . The basic rule and moves are simple enough , but there are many strategies that players need to learn . 
I like playing cards . I � m pretty good at poker . Do you play cards ? 
I � m terrible at cards and so I never play games which involve gambling , like poker . If I did , I � d lose all my money . 
Do you play bridge ? 
Yes , I do . It � s hard to find four players though , so I don � t play very often . Do you know anyone who plays ? If so , we could set up a game . 
I can play quite well . I have a friend who likes playing , but she � s not very good at it . Shall I invite her to play ? 
Sure , I have a friend who play fairly well . We should find out when our friends are free and arrange a game . 
I � ll call my friend now . you call yours . ,          ,          
Canyou give me more details on what is included in the package ? 
Sure . The coach leaves at : a . m . , in front of our office . The drive takes eight hours , with two stops to see some sights . 
What about the hotel accommodations ? 
Youll be staying at Holiday Inn . Its a three-star hotel with two restaurants and a swimming pool . 
Great . What types of things will we do at Lushun Falls ? 
The second day you take a four-hour city tour . In the afternoon you go on the famous boat cruise under the falls . ,     ,     
Hello,  . 
Oh hello , Sally . This is Dave Thomson here . Could I speak to Jim please ? 
Im afraid hes not in at the moment Dave . He went out about an hour ago and hes not back yet . 
Any idea when he might be back ? 
Well , he shouldnt be long . He said he was just going to get some paint . But I wouldnt be surprised if hes stopped off at the pub on the way back . 
OK . well , tell him Ive called , will you , and Ill try again later . 
All right . Goodbye , Dave .   Thanks then Sally . Goodbye . ,       ,

Just a sec I � m just gonna vacuum this rug real fast 
Wait ! Don � t turn it on ... ,          ,          
Goodafternoon , welcome to IBA . How can I be of service ? 
Id like to talk to somebody about the Group Account Deposit Service . 
This refers to the deposit business offered to the level  account of group companies . 
What is it used for ? I mean , why bother to get this special account ? 
Group companies can use this to make their arrangement of funds flexible , when dealing with their subsidiaries . 
I see , so this can really cut down on time and centralise management . Interesting ... ,     ,     
Isthis a duty-free shop ?   Yes , sir . What can I do for you ? 
I want to buy some specialties . Can you recommend me some ? 
Sure . I strongly advise you to buy a bottle of perfume and a lighter .

Couldyou show me what youve got ? 
Weve got several good chicken dishes if you like chicken . 
Well try one of your specials this time .   This is worth trying . ,   ,   
Welcometo China , Mr . Smith . 
Thank you . So pleasant to meet you here ! 
I heard that you are interested in our silk skirts and new style of coats . 
Yes , Ive brought a list of your recent products with me . Wed like to import some of your latest clothes for the second half of this year . Were ready to place an order with you . 
Great ! B , most of the items listed are available this year . I hope we can come to an agreement and sign the contracts , so as to enable our timely delivery . 
That sounds good . But I have a proposal now . 
Whats the proposal ?

Besides , Internet tends to be more essential now in the information age . 
Good idea . A network of work stations is helpful for our management . 
And , to be frank , our copying machines are too slow ; our telephone system is limited in function . 
You are right . The current equipment of our offices really falls behind . Next week , you can provide me a catalogue of new equipment . ,      ,

Ifind that you spend little on handset charge every month . Have you any trick ? 
Its simple . You can use call transfer .   Is it so simple ? 
Sure . You know , we spend most of our time at home or in the office every day , so I receive handset calls with the hand-free telephone , so I need pay little for receiving calls . 
Its true . 
Call transfer has many other advantages . When I am in places where network cant cover , such as the high building , I also use call transfer function , which transfers my calls to the hand-free telephone and I will not miss any call . 
Thats all ? 
In hospitals or on planes , handsets will interfere with some equip-ment , so we must close our handsets . If you set call transfer , the problem will be solved . ,       ,

Here you are . And here are three crash helmets . 
Thanks . Well , those two kids are beginners . What should I do about their safety ?
